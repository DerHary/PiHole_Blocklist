# PiHole_Blocklist
My Custom Blocklist for PiHole

I decided to share my custom Domain Blacklist via Github.
Updates will follow in irregular Intervals, when i check the Logs of my PiHole and diverse Domains that are resolved.

You can add the List to your PiHole in Management Interface > Group Management > Adlists
Add as URL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hary74656/PiHole_Blocklist/main/Harys_BlackList.txt and a Comment.
Click Add.
After that go to Tools > Update Gravity > Click Update.
This will update all the Lists you have in PiHole, including mine.
