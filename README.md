# PiHole_Blocklist
My Custom Blocklist for PiHole

I decided to share my custom Domain Blacklist via Github.
Updates will follow in irregular Intervals, when i check the Logs of my PiHole and diverse Domains that are resolved.

You can add the List to your PiHole in Management Interface > Group Management > Adlists
